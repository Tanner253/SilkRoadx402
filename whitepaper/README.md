# SilkRoadx402

The first decentralized marketplace for private software sales using x402 payments on Solana.

## What is SilkRoadx402?

SilkRoadx402 is an anonymous marketplace where developers can list and sell their private software, tools, bots, and scripts using x402 micropayments on the Solana blockchain. No accounts, no identity requirements—just your wallet and your code.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Payments**: Custom x402 protocol implementation
- **Blockchain**: Solana (@solana/web3.js v1.98.4)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose models)
- **Storage**: Cloudinary for images
- **Encryption**: AES-256 (crypto-js)
- **Authentication**: JWT + Wallet signatures

### Key Technologies
- **SPL Token**: USDC transfers via @solana/spl-token
- **Wallet Adapter**: Phantom, Solflare, etc. support
- **HTTP 402**: Native browser implementation
- **Real-time Balance**: RPC polling with caching

## Getting Started

This is the whitepaper/landing page repository. For the main application, see `../silkroad/`.

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the whitepaper site.

### Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed on Vercel via GitHub integration:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

## 💡 Investment Highlights

### What Makes This Real

1. **Working Product**: Full x402 implementation with real USDC transfers on Solana
2. **No Vaporware**: Sellers can create listings and receive payments today
3. **Open Protocol**: Built on x402 standard (HTTP 402 Payment Required)
4. **Real Innovation**: First marketplace to use x402 for software sales
5. **Market Fit**: Targets developers with private tools who want anonymity

### Platform Economics

- **Token Gate**: 50k $SRx402 creates constant buying pressure
- **Zero Platform Fees**: 100% of revenue goes to sellers (sustainable via token requirement)
- **Direct Payments**: Buyer → Seller on-chain, no escrow delays
- **Sub-second Settlement**: Solana's 400ms block time enables instant delivery

## Legal

SilkRoadx402 prohibits the sale of illegal software, malware, or tools that violate US regulations. The platform operates as a peer-to-peer marketplace with no liability for user-generated listings.

**Platform Fees:**
- 0% platform fees (token gate model instead)
- Sellers keep 100% of revenue
- Only pay blockchain transaction costs (~$0.000005 per transaction)

This zero-fee structure is sustainable because the 50,000 $SRx402 token requirement creates demand and filters for serious users.

---

**Current Status:** Core functionality complete. Final testing in progress. Mainnet launch planned Q4 2025.

**Repository:** This is the whitepaper site. Main application code in `../silkroad/`.
