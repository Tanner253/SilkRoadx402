## üéØ **What is SilkRoadx402?**

SilkRoadx402 is a **peer-to-peer marketplace** where developers can anonymously sell private software‚Äîtrading bots, tools, scripts, APIs‚Äîand get paid instantly in USDC on Solana. No identity verification, no middlemen, just wallet-to-wallet commerce powered by the x402 payment protocol.

### **The Problem**
- Traditional platforms (Gumroad, Stripe) require **full KYC**, tax forms, and bank accounts
- Sellers wait **days** for payouts and lose **15-30%** to fees
- No anonymous option for privacy-focused developers selling sensitive tools

### **Our Solution**
- ‚úÖ **Zero KYC** - Connect your Solana wallet and start selling in 60 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Instant Settlement** - Get paid in under 1 second via smart contract escrow
- ‚úÖ **0.5% Fees** - Keep 99.5% of your revenue (vs. 15-30% elsewhere)
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous by Default** - No personal info, just your wallet address
- ‚úÖ **Legal Software Only** - Strict US compliance, no illegal tools

## üí∞ **Tokenomics: $SRx402**

**Token:** $SRx402 (Solana SPL token)  
**Contract:** `49AfJsWb9E7VjBDTdZ2DjnSLFgSEvCoP1wdXuhHbpump`

### **Fee Structure**
| Software Type | Platform Fee | Fee Usage |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Standard/Compliant** | 0.5% | Platform operations |
| **High-Risk** (at discretion) | 35% | $SRx402 buyback & burn (not profit) |

**Why the dual fee?** High-risk fees protect the platform from profiting off questionable software. Instead, 35% goes to **buying back and burning $SRx402**, creating deflationary pressure while maintaining legal distance.

## üöÄ **How x402 Works**

x402 is an open protocol built on the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code:

1. **Request:** Buyer clicks "Buy" on a software listing
2. **402 Response:** Server responds with payment parameters (amount, recipient address, USDC mint)
3. **Sign Payment:** Buyer's wallet (e.g., Phantom) signs a payment authorization
4. **Verify & Settle:** Server verifies signature, broadcasts SPL transfer to Solana (~400ms)
5. **Deliver:** Download link released to buyer upon confirmation

**Result:** No accounts, no chargebacks, no friction‚Äîjust pure peer-to-peer commerce.
