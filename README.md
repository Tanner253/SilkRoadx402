# SilkRoadx402

The first decentralized marketplace for private software sales using x402 payments on Solana.

## What is SilkRoadx402?

SilkRoadx402 is an anonymous marketplace where developers can list and sell their private software, tools, bots, and scripts using x402 micropayments on the Solana blockchain. No accounts, no identity requirementsâ€”just your wallet and your code.

## Key Features

- **Zero KYC**: No identity verification, no bank accounts, no tax forms required
- **Anonymous Listings**: Sell without revealing your identity
- **Instant Payments**: Get paid in USDC on Solana in under 1 second
- **x402 Protocol**: HTTP-based micropayments with zero friction
- **0.5% Fees**: Keep 99.5% of your revenue on standard listings
- **Encrypted Storage**: Secure, encrypted file storage
- **Legal Only**: Strict compliance with US regulations

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the whitepaper site.

### Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed on Vercel via GitHub integration:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Payments**: x402 protocol
- **Blockchain**: Solana (USDC SPL tokens)
- **Storage**: Encrypted cloud storage

## Legal

SilkRoadx402 prohibits the sale of illegal software, malware, or tools that violate US regulations. The platform operates as a peer-to-peer marketplace with no liability for user-generated listings.

**Platform Fees:**
- 0.5% on standard software transactions
- 35% on high-risk listings (at platform discretion, used exclusively for SRx402 token buyback/burn, not profit)

This dual-fee structure protects the platform from profiting off potentially problematic software. Non-compliant or illegal software will not be listed.
